<p>Who are these people or ... more appropriately: who were these people? Due to their relative anonymity giving some detailed biographic concerning their friends, family, lovers, life passions, hopes for their futures,  etc. is somewhat difficult to do, though they likely and at the very least deserve that much. Now, let's see if the following series of names / aliases ring any bells:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dennis Rader aka BTK</li>
  <li>Gary Ridgeway aka the Green River Killer</li>
  <li>John Wayne Gacy aka the Killer Clown </li>
</ul>
<p>If you recognize these names, you're either a bit too dedicated when it comes to watching the 5 o'clock news or you are a true crime buff — or at the very least an aspiring 'buffling,' 'bufflette.' It is possible you are neither and the scope of these men's atrocities has been burned into living memory. The names listed above are all but SOME of the poor souls savagely murdered by these lowlife pathetic excuse for human beings. Yet their cruelty has bought them a certain immortality. Through their cold-hearted acts they have elevated 'themselves' to the American Pantheon of Serial Killers. But wait — did they actually do that or did we?</p>
<p>I will admit, like you perhaps, I consume a lot of True Crime specials ... I think I, like many, have a certain morbid interest in the depravity and psychotic traits, which can manifest themselves and incur such bewilderment and grief. </p>
